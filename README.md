# VBA-challenge
University of Birmingham / Data Analysis Assignment 

I made a script that loops through all the stocks for every year / sheet and outputs the following information:


- The ticker symbol.


- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


- The total stock volume of the stock.


BONUS

I've added functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
